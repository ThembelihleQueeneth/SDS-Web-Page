        <h1>OSHA(Occupational Safety and Health Administration) Electrical Safety Standard 1926.431</h1>
        <p>This standard relates to equipment upkeep and maintenance. If employers don't inspect, repair, and upgrade their machinery,
             that can lead to failure and electrical injury or death. 
             This specific standard refers to the construction industry, but the recommendations work well for all job sites. Some elements of standard 1926.431 include:</p>

        <h2>8 General Safety Tips for Working with Electrical Wires</h2>
        <p id="para">Before your employees start working with or around electrical wires, they should be trained in proper safety techniques and precautions. Here are some generalized tips that can help prevent a disaster.</p>
            <div class="container">
            <div class="tip">
                <h4>1. Make a Plan</h4>
                <img src="assets/plan.png" alt="" >
                <p>The best way to avoid harm is to draft a project plan beforehand. During the planning phase, workers can assess the equipment and environment to spot any potential hazards.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h4>2. Wear the Right Clothing and Gear</h4>
                <img src="assets/clothing.avif" alt="" >
                <p>As we mentioned, OSHA requirements say that workers should have rubber gloves, insulating sleeves, and safety glasses on at all times. Fire-resistant clothing can also help prevent injury because the fibres are not very conductive or are treated with a flame-retardant.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h4>3. Use the Buddy System</h4>
                <img src="assets/buddy system.jpeg" alt="" >
                <p>Should the worst happen, your workers shouldn't be by themselves on the job. A buddy system helps ensure that someone can always call for help if necessary or perform CPR. Both individuals should be trained in electrical safety and CPR before starting work.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h4>4.Use the Lock Out Tag Out (LOTO) System</h4>
                <img src="assets/LOTO.jpeg" alt="" >
                <p>There are six steps to the LOTO system, and they can help ensure that all circuits are shut off and de-energized before working. De-energizing a circuit simply means making sure that there is no residual power left in the wires or machinery.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h4>5. Avoid Working in Wet Areas</h4>
                <img src="assets/wet-floor.jpeg" alt="" >
                <p>Since water is such a potent electrical conductor, it can pose significant safety risks on a job site. Even damp areas can be a problem, so workers must be able to address it. For example, if there is standing water on the ground, employees can either dry it off or cover it with non-conductive material (i.e., a wooden board).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h4>6. Use a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI)</h4>
                <img src="assets/Ground-Fault-Circuit-Interrupters.jpg" alt="" >
                <p>GFCIs are portable devices that workers can plug into an outlet or circuit. If there is a power surge because someone is getting electrocuted, the GFCI will detect it and kill the power automatically. Using these devices can act as a final failsafe just in case something else goes wrong.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h4>7. Stay Away from Overhead Power Lines</h4>
                <img src="assets/Overhead-Lines-Conductors.jpg" alt="" >
                <p>OSHA recommends a minimum safe distance of 10 feet from any overhead electrical wires. Many injuries and accidents happen because of overhead lines, so workers should be hyper-aware of them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h4>8. Inspect Power Cords and Outlets for Damage</h4>
                <img src="assets/electrical-cord.jpeg" alt="" >
                <p>Finally, workers should check all electrical wires and elements, including plugs and outlets. Any damaged components should get replaced immediately. For example, if a three-pronged plug is missing the grounding prong, employees should swap it out with a new plug. They should look for signs of burning or charring, as that can indicate exposed wiring and potential electrical sparks.</p>
